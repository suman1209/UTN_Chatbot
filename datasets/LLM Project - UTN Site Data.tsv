Students moving to a new city can choose from various accommodation options, including student dormitories, shared apartments (WGs), private apartments, subleases, and temporary rentals. Each option offers different advantages depending on budget, lifestyle preferences, and availability. Student dormitories are affordable and provide an opportunity to quickly connect with other students, while shared apartments allow for communal living at a lower cost. Private apartments offer more independence but are usually more expensive. Subleases are ideal for short-term stays, especially for students who are still exploring the city. Temporary housing is a flexible option for those who have not yet secured permanent accommodation.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Who can apply for student dormitories, and what are the benefits?	Student dormitories are available exclusively to students and offer several benefits, such as affordability and a sense of community. The rent is generally lower compared to private apartments, making it a budget-friendly choice. Additionally, most dormitories provide essential furnishings, including a bed, wardrobe, table, and chair, which simplifies the moving process, particularly for international students. Living in a student dormitory also facilitates social interaction with fellow students, helping newcomers adjust more easily to their new environment.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What kind of rooms are available in student dormitories?	The types of rooms in student dormitories vary depending on the specific residence. Some dormitories offer private studio apartments, while others provide rooms in shared apartments where common areas such as kitchens and bathrooms are shared among residents. Unlike in some English-speaking countries, it is uncommon in Germany for students to share a single room with another person. The choice between a private room and a shared apartment often depends on availability, personal preference, and budget.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What facilities do student dormitories offer?	Student dormitories generally provide a range of facilities that enhance the convenience of student life. Many include common areas such as lounges and study rooms, allowing students to socialize and work in a quiet environment. Laundry rooms, gyms, and parking spaces are also commonly available. Some dormitories offer additional services such as on-site administration or janitorial staff who serve as points of contact for students in case of issues or maintenance requests. Family apartments at reduced prices are sometimes available for students who need accommodation for themselves and their families.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How much does a room in a student dormitory cost?	The cost of living in a student dormitory depends on various factors, including the provider, location, room type, and available facilities. On average, students should expect to pay between 200 and 600 euros per month for a dormitory room. More affordable options tend to have longer waitlists, sometimes lasting several semesters.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How can students apply for dormitory accommodation?	Students interested in dormitory accommodation must apply through the relevant housing providers, such as Studierendenwerke or private dormitory operators. Universities typically do not arrange rooms directly but maintain contact with the housing providers. Application deadlines, available room types, and rental costs vary by provider, so students should check the respective websites for detailed information. It is advisable to apply as early as possible due to high demand.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	  What is a shared apartment (WG), and why is it popular among students?	A shared apartment, known as a WG (Wohngemeinschaft) in Germany, is a popular housing choice where tenants share common spaces like the kitchen, living room, and bathroom while having a private bedroom. This type of living arrangement lowers individual rent costs and fosters a social environment. Many WGs emphasize communal living, often hosting shared activities or parties, making them a preferred option for students looking to engage with others.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How do students apply for shared apartments (WGs)?	To apply for a WG, students typically search for available rooms on websites dedicated to shared housing. When a room becomes available, existing tenants often conduct interviews, known as WG castings, to select a new roommate. It is important to attend these meetings and get to know potential housemates, as compatibility in lifestyle and habits is key to a pleasant shared living experience.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Who should consider renting a private apartment?	Renting a private apartment is ideal for students who prefer independence, quiet living, or need accommodation for their families. Private apartments offer flexibility in terms of location, size, and amenities but tend to be more expensive than shared housing options. Finding a private rental often requires searching on real estate websites or contacting local landlords.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What is a sublease, and why is it a good option for students?	A sublease is a temporary rental agreement where a tenant rents out their apartment or room while they are away for an extended period. This is a convenient option for students who need short-term accommodation, as sublet properties are often furnished and ready for immediate move-in. In shared apartments, subleases also provide an opportunity to meet new people and potentially secure long-term housing.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What should students be cautious about when subletting?	When subletting, students should ensure they receive a formal rental agreement and a tenancy confirmation (Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from the landlord. This document is required for registering at the Residents’ Registration Office. Students should avoid informal or verbal agreements to prevent legal and financial complications.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What can students do if they do not find an apartment immediately?	If students do not find permanent housing immediately, they can consider short-term accommodations such as temporary rentals, hostels, or serviced apartments. These options tend to be more expensive but provide flexibility while searching for long-term housing. Some universities and student organizations also offer temporary housing assistance for newly arrived students.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What are the best tips for finding student accommodation?	To increase their chances of finding suitable accommodation, students should start their search early, apply to multiple providers, and remain flexible regarding location and rental terms. Using various channels such as real estate websites, social media, and university housing services can also be helpful. Ensuring that all application profiles and requests include detailed and accurate information improves the likelihood of receiving positive responses from landlords.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How can students recognize rental scams?	Students should be cautious when searching for accommodation online, as rental scams are common. They should never transfer money or share sensitive personal information before visiting the apartment and signing a legitimate contract. If an offer seems suspiciously cheap or the landlord avoids in-person meetings, it may be fraudulent. Generally, apartment viewings in Germany are free, and legitimate landlords do not require upfront payments before signing a lease.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
				
Rental Contract				
	How do I sign a rental contract in Germany?	Once you and your landlord or landlady have signed the rental contract, you are legally bound by its terms. You must then pay the deposit and the first month’s rent. Before signing, landlords usually require documents like proof of income, an employment contract, proof of financial resources, or a residence permit. In return, the landlord must provide an energy certificate.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What documents do I need to provide before signing a lease?	Landlords and property managers typically request documents such as proof of income, an employment contract, proof of sufficient financial resources, and a residence permit before allowing you to sign the rental contract. These documents help confirm that you can afford the rent.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What should I check in my rental contract before signing?	Before signing, check that the landlord’s address is correctly stated, your name is complete and accurate, and the apartment size is properly mentioned. Rooms below two meters high do not count as living space, and balconies or terraces are calculated at half their actual size. Make sure all conditions, including rent, ancillary costs, and deposit, are clearly mentioned.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Can I sublet my apartment while studying in Germany?	If you wish to sublet your apartment, you must ensure that this is explicitly allowed in your rental contract. Subletting without permission could lead to legal issues or even termination of the lease.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Am I allowed to have pets in my student apartment?	Keeping dogs and cats in the apartment is only allowed if explicitly mentioned in the rental contract. However, small pets such as fish, birds, hamsters, and guinea pigs do not require special permission from the landlord.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Who is responsible for repairs in my rental apartment?	In general, the landlord is responsible for all necessary repairs in the apartment. However, the rental contract may include a clause requiring you to handle minor repairs yourself. Some restrictions, like being required to paint walls a certain color, are legally invalid even if included in the lease.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How long is a typical rental contract for students?	Rental agreements are usually for an indefinite period. A fixed-term lease is only allowed if a valid reason, such as the landlord’s personal use, is stated in the contract. If there is no special reason for termination, tenants typically have a three-month notice period.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Can my landlord increase my rent every year?	Rent increases are regulated, and landlords cannot raise the rent arbitrarily. If there is a graduated rent agreement in your contract, the rent will increase automatically at fixed intervals. Otherwise, rent may only be increased once every twelve months and by a maximum of 20% within three years, following local comparative rent regulations.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What is the difference between cold rent and warm rent?	Cold rent refers to the base cost of renting the apartment without additional expenses. Warm rent includes the cold rent plus ancillary costs such as water, garbage collection, janitorial services, and certain taxes. The warm rent is usually calculated with an estimated advance payment and adjusted annually based on actual consumption.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Do I need to pay extra costs besides my monthly rent?	Yes, besides rent, you may have to pay additional costs like electricity, gas (if not included in warm rent), and broadcasting fees. Depending on your consumption, you may also need to make additional payments if your annual service charge statement shows higher-than-expected usage.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How do I set up electricity and gas for my apartment?	Your lease will specify whether heating costs are included. If your apartment has a floor heating system, you may need to choose a gas supplier and pay separately for heating. Electricity contracts are almost always the tenant’s responsibility. You can compare providers online to find a suitable tariff. Bills are issued annually based on your consumption.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	Do I have to pay broadcasting fees as a student?	Yes, every household in Germany must pay broadcasting fees, currently €18.36 per month. Registration happens automatically after you register at the Residents' Registration Office. However, if you live in a shared apartment, only one person needs to pay the fee, so it’s best to discuss it with your roommates.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	How much is the rental deposit, and when do I get it back?	The rental deposit cannot exceed three months’ cold rent. It must be paid at the beginning of the lease but can be split into three monthly installments. The landlord must place the deposit in an interest-bearing account. After moving out, you will get your deposit back, including interest, as long as there are no damages to the apartment.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What is an all-inclusive rent, and is it a good option for students?	All-inclusive rent covers all costs, including utilities, in a fixed price, except for the deposit. Unlike warm rent, where costs are calculated based on usage, all-inclusive rent remains constant. This can be convenient for students since it eliminates unexpected additional payments, but it also means you cannot reduce costs through lower consumption.	Life in Germany/Nuremberg	
	What should I do if I find damages in my apartment after moving in?	When moving in, a protocol documenting the apartment’s condition is created. If you notice damages after receiving the keys, report them to your landlord within 14 days. If you fail to report them, you may be held responsible for existing damages when you move out.
